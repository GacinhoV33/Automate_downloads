# Automate_downloads
This app has two way of working:
1) Segregating files in one specified directory by their extensions. For example it groups all pdf, doc, csv files in doc_files directory.
2) Automaticly copy files from Downloads or directory where screenshots are dropped and group them into folders with data and extension.
 For example I used this app to group my screenshots from Lectures and Laboratories and it's putted in named and chronological folders. I just had to specified names of lectures
 and time in csv file called "Data.xls"
